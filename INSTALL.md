# Get PcapInspect's dependencies

PcapInspect requires `python3`, `matplotlib`, `numpy` and `tshark`.

I've found it handy to develop PcapInspect in [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) which
enables interactive development in a browser, including embedded display of any
graphics generated by PcapInspect.

Strictly speaking, Jupyter itself is not a dependency, but I'd recommend it
for interactive development, and because its docker image comes with some of
PcapInspect's dependencies (`matplotlib` and `numpy`) pre-installed.


## Clone the PcapInspect repo in the container
For each of the installation types below, you'll need to clone the PcapInspect repo via passwordless HTTPS:

    git clone https://github.com/aristanetworks/pcapinspect.git
Or ssh (Requires [SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)):

    git clone git@github.com:aristanetworks/pcapinspect.git


## Ubuntu (Tried on 18.04.5 LTS)
    sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip tshark
    sudo -H pip3 install matplotlib numpy

When running `pip3` using `sudo` in the past, I have seen a warning suggesting I use
`pip3 install --user` instead of `sudo`. Perhaps these instructions should be updated
accordingly.

## macOS (Tried on Mojave 10.14.6)
There are other ways to get `tshark`, but I did it using
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). Here it's part of `wireshark`.

    pip3 install numpy matplotlib
    brew cask install wireshark
    export PATH=/Applications/Wireshark.app/Contents/MacOS:$PATH


## Jupyter
Note that:
- The Jupyter container comes with `matplotlib` and `numpy` pre-installed.
- As of 16-Oct-2020, the Jupyter docker images are based on Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS.


### Setup Docker

If your system doesn't already have Docker, you'll need to setup it up first to be
able follow these instructions. See, for example, [Docker's 'get started'
page](https://www.docker.com/get-started). Although these instructions run Jupyter
in a Docker container, that is not a requirement in order to be able to use PcapInspect
with Jupyter - it should work in any environment that Jupyter runs in.

### Installing and starting Jupyter

I used the [jupyter/scipy-notebook](https://hub.docker.com/r/jupyter/scipy-notebook)
image from the list of variants decribed
[here](https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/selecting.html).

Run this command to get the docker image:

    docker pull jupyter/scipy-notebook:latest

See also the [Jupyter docker quickstart guide](https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks).

To start Jupyter, run this command:

    docker run -d --restart unless-stopped --name pcapinspect --publish 16681:8888 --volume $HOME/path/to/a/directory:/pcapinspect jupyter/scipy-notebook

On my server (us124), this makes Jupyter accessible via <http://us124:16681/>

The user in the container is `jovyan` - see <https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/community/content-community.html#what-is-a-jovyan>

Be careful giving a container access to your home-directory like this via `--volume`! This makes the specified directory available at `/pcapinspect` within the container which makes it easy to get data into and out of the container.


### Granting jovyan sudo privileges

For doing things like installing packages, it can be handy for `jovyan` to have `sudo` privileges.

1.  Via `/etc/sudoers` (This used to work for me, but didn't the last time I tried it 😞️)

    Set `jovyan`'s password and add to `sudo` group:
    
        ~ @us124>  docker exec -it --user root pcapinspect /bin/bash
        (base) root@4b041e205c76:~# passwd jovyan
        (base) root@4b041e205c76:~# usermod -aG sudo jovyan
    
    Edit `/etc/sudoers` to "allow members of group sudo to execute any command":
    
        (base) jovyan@4b041e205c76:~$ sudo diff --unified /etc/sudoers.orig /etc/sudoers
        --- /etc/sudoers.orig   2020-10-15 16:12:51.406019658 +0000
        +++ /etc/sudoers        2020-10-15 16:17:04.512175793 +0000
        @@ -23,7 +23,7 @@

        +%sudo  ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
        
         # See sudoers(5) for more information on "#include" directives:

2.  Via `GRANT_SUDO` (not tried yet)

    Alternatively, for passwordless sudo, set the `GRANT_SUDO` env var when starting the container:
    <https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks/issues/408#issuecomment-352764277>


### tshark

To enter the container as `jovyan` and install `tshark` run the following commands:

    docker exec -it --user jovyan pcapinspect /bin/bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt-get install -y tshark

## Other packages possibly needed in the container

`ping` is not provided in the container by default. To get it, run:

    sudo apt-get install -y iputils-ping

If you want to push changes to a fork of PcapInspect from within the Jupyter container,
you'll need an [SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).
To generate the SSH key, you'll need to install `openssh-client` to get `ssh-keygen`:

    sudo apt-get install -y openssh-client


### Accessing Jupyter

To access Jupyter via a browser, you need a token. To see the token, do this:

    docker exec pcapinspect jupyter notebook list

This prints something like:

    http://0.0.0.0:8888/?token=2ce42b6b124948850309877863683a44698c926e618a96b4 :: /home/jovyan

So, to access Jupyter, as I'm on the server called us124 and with the port setting in
the `docker run` command above, I use this instead:

    http://us124:16681/?token=2ce42b6b124948850309877863683a44698c926e618a96b4

So far, the token has changed each time I have restarted the container.
